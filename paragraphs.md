things to check for each paragraph


1. sequence old to new: start with previously introduced concepts before exposing readers to new concepts (eg, when introducing new notation, define it before first use)
2. sequence light to heavy: sequence sentences with sentences that start light/succint, follow-up with "heavy" details
3. use transitional words to establish logical relationship between sentences
4. use "echo words", ie, be consistent with nomenclature to bury the concept into their heads
5. use strong verbs, action verbs, rather than passive verbs.
9. when introducing a novel concept/word/equation/notation/etc., always explain it *before* usage, rather than after; else the reader will not understand when reading it, and we don't want that!
3. first sentence of every paragraph describes the entire paragraph
3. last sentence of every paragraph links to next paragraph
4. re-word passive tense, "it can be shown", to active, "we show" (but without "we")
5. make sure tense is consistent within a paragraph.  and past tense is only for things that you or other people did.
6. no need to write, "Next, we ...", the structure of the paragraphs should flow into one another.
1. whenever possible, use familiar terms/notation.
1. when providing a p-value, always specify which test statistic (and parameters) are used (never use a t-test).
