check all these things before submitting a manuscript:


1. title < 80 characters
2. abstract < 250 words 
3. follow organization in  [draft.md](draft.md)
for
	4. abstract
	4. intro 
	4. methods
	4. results
	4. discussion
5. all figures/tables satisfy [figures.md](figures.md)
7. word use satisfies [words.md](words.md)
8. paragraphs satisfy [paragraphs.md](paragraphs.md)
9. do *not* provide a pargraphical outline, readers can get the outline by looking at the section headers, the outline is not part of the narative, so it breaks up the flow of text.
1. be consistent with dummy variables, that is, if you use "i" to index samples, don't use it elsewhere for something else.  each letter gets a character.
9. you get 1 new concept/acronym, choose it wisely and use it often.
