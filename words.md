check for these words, and remove/replace as appropriate

1. check for any misspelled words using spellcheck

3. replace colloquialisms with more formal words (eg, nowadays --> recently)
2. i, we, our, us, you, your --> rewrite sentence
3. in order to/for --> to/for

5. this, it --> be specific,  can often be vague to which noun this/it is referring
6. very --> use a stronger adjective/adverb
8. data is --> data are
9. novel --> remove,  novelty should be implied by context, if it is not clear by context, update context
11. most/least/best/worst/better/worse/optimal/*est: requires a citation as it is an empirical claim, or evidence, and a dimension along which the comparison is made
12. no reason --> remove, somebody might have a reason that we haven't thought of, so think harder about the reasons, and be more specific
13. essential/necessary --> probably remove, things are essential/necessary only in very special cases, eg, logic; otherwise, we probably just aren't creative enough. you might mean useful.

11. usually --> same deal, either provide a citation/evidence, or don't say it
21. as such --> ok sparsely, but often overused, check and revise sentences.
22. numbers have space before unit, eg 1GB --> 1 GB.
23. first --> somebody reading this will think they did it first, and they are at least partially correct. firstness should be implied by context.
24. in this manuscript --> nothing, it is implied.
25. a priori --> should be italics
1. we want to --> we (though should be reworded to avoid "we" entirely)
1. Fig, Fig., fig --> Figure
